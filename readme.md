ðŸ§  Here's a breakdown of the three packages:
langchain
â†’ The main package that brings everything together (depends on the others internally).

langchain-core
â†’ Contains the core abstractions and interfaces (e.g., PromptTemplate, Runnable, etc.).

langchain-community
â†’ Hosts integrations, tools, models, and utilities contributed by the community.
